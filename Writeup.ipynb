    "### 1. Read all test images \n",
    "![alt text][image1]\n",
    "### 2. Covert to grayscale \n",
    "**Reflection:** It is hard to tell the difference between white lines and yellow in grayscale images. Besides, grayscale images also easily fail to detect lane lines when there are some shadows due to some trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** I use color selection techniques to pick White line and Yellow line\n",

    "#### Secondly, apply color selection teniques and merge with initial images\n",

    "    **Approach:** Firstly, I calculated slope, intercept and length for every hough line segment (left and right) and stroe them into a list. Secondly, I utilized the length of each line segment as weight to calculate the average of slope and intercept. Finally, I use constant y1 and y2 which are relevant to the margin of the mask region and calculate x1 and x2 by using the average slope and intercept.\n",
