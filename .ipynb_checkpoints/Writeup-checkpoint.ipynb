    "## The step of building pipeline\n",
    "### 1. Read all test images \n",
    "![alt text][image1]\n",
    "### 2. Covert to grayscale \n",
    "**Reflection:** It is hard to tell the difference between white lines and yellow in grayscale images. Besides, grayscale images also easily fail to detect lane lines when there are some shadows due to some trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** I use color selection techniques to pick White line and Yellow line\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "### 3. Color selection  \n",
    "#### Fristly, covert initial RGB image to HSL image\n",
    "![alt text][image3]\n",
    "#### Secondly, apply color selection teniques and merge with initial images\n",
    "![alt text][image4]\n",
    "#### Reference: https://github.com/naokishibuya/car-finding-lane-lines\n",
    "### 4. Canny edge detection\n",
    "* Covert masked hls images to grayscale\n",
    "* Apply gaussian smoothing with kernel = 5\n",
    "* Apply Canny function\n",
    "![alt text][image5]\n",
    "### 5. Mask region of interest\n",
    "![alt text][image6]\n",
    "### 6. Hough transform and Draw line\n",
    "![alt text][image7]\n",
    "### 7. Draw extension line\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Approach:** Firstly, I calculated slope, intercept and length for every hough line segment (left and right) and stroe them into a list. Secondly, I utilized the length of each line segment as weight to calculate the average of slope and intercept. Finally, I use constant y1 and y2 which are relevant to the margin of the mask region and calculate x1 and x2 by using the average slope and intercept.\n",

    "## Potential shortcomings\n",
    "* The lines on the videos are not stable and shake a lot\n",
    "* Drawing a straight line may cause problem when the car is turining\n",
    "* This pipeline is not tested to apply in different videos with different light condition and weather\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Suggestions\n",
    "* To remove shekiness, a easy way is to average the current frame lines with the previous frame lines\n",
    "* It is possible to detect the curve ahead and then extrapolate a polygon line based on the slopes of the previous lines/frames\n",
    "* To improve the performance of pipeline and apply to a variety situation, one way it to utilize auto thresholding for Canny Edge Detection   \n"
